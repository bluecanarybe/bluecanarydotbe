								<li class="icon fa-check-square-o">
									<h3>Cyber Security check-up</h3>
									<p>We will assess your overal cyber security maturity by testing how your systems and applications are protected against most common attacks (e.g. ransomware, vulnerable systems, ..) and how your resilience can be improved.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Penetration testing</h3>
									<p>For a number of days, we will act both as an external attacker and a malicious insider to attempt to penetrate and compromise your internal network and applications.</p>
									<p>We also offer penetration testing against specific targets (e.g. web applications)</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-fire">
									<h3>Incident response & disaster recovery</h3>
									<p>We can assist you with drafting procedures to minimise the damage and recover as soon as possible when the unthinkable happens.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-envelope">
									<h3>Social Engineering</h3>
									<p>We will setup and launch a phishing attack against your business to create cyber security awareness amongst your employees.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-unlock-alt">
									<h3>Anti-ransomware prevention</h3>
									<p>Ransomware attacks are on the rise. Businesses have held hostage for weeks and extorted to pay bitcoins to restore their systems and data. Whilst it is notoriously difficult to recover from a ransomware attack, we can assist you in taking steps to prevent or greatly minimise the impact of such attack. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-shield">
									<h3>CISO as a service</h3>
									<p>We understand small and medium-sized businesses often do not require or have the budget to have a full-time CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) on-premise. Our CISO-as-a-service is a cost-effective solution to have an experienced and certified CISO on board in your organization to help your organiation manage cyber security risks and incidents. </p>
